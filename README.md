# Problem Statement

The task at hand is to efficiently retrieve the most relevant resumes from a dataset given a job description. We aim to develop a system that leverages natural language processing techniques and similarity measures to identify resumes that closely align with the requirements outlined in a job description.

# Explanation

### Text Preprocessing: 
A clean_text function is likely employed to standardize the text in both job descriptions and resumes (removing stop words, punctuation, etc.).
### TF-IDF Vectorization: 
The vectorizer.transform and tfidf_matrix indicate the use of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert textual data into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of words in each document.
### Cosine Similarity:
The cosine_similarity function calculates the similarity between the job description vector and each resume vector. Higher cosine similarity scores indicate a stronger semantic match.
### Filtering and Ranking:
The code identifies the top 5 resumes with similarity scores exceeding a threshold (0.2), ensuring a minimum level of relevance.
### Output: 
The get_similar_resumes function returns the top matching resumes, along with their similarity scores, for further analysis or presentation.
